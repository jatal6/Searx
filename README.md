# üîé What is Searx?

Searx is a search engine that allows you to search multiple different engines at once (also known as a metasearch engine) and removes all kinds of personal information from your queries. In this project we setup searx on an AWS EC2 instance.

# üìù Setting up our AWS EC2 Instance

In our project, we utilized an Ubuntu server using version 20.04 LTS (t2.micro type).

In order to enhance security for server root access, we used the amazons key pair to securely connect to our instance using OpenSSH with RSA encryption.

Once the instance has started running, we used SSH to connect to the instance on an ubuntu based virtual machine using the following command `ssh -i ~/.ssh/searxEc2.pem ubuntu@my.instance.ip`

# üìù Setting up the security groups

Security groups act as a firewall that are setup to only allow traffic from specified ports as well as limiting who may access the EC2 instance. In the "Security Groups" tab under Network & Security, we are able to configure our specific security groups. Based on the image below, we only allow inbound traffic from ports 4041, 80, 20, 4040, 443, and 8080.

# :house: Setting up domain

In our project we used AWS's Route 53 service to setup a custom domain and point our instance's public IP address to redirect and route traffic to it.

Once the type A DNS record is created with our instance public IP, we waited for Route 53 to propagate so we can utilize the server through the domain[` https://team1search.com/`](https://team1search.com/).

# Instillation of Docker + Searx

In our instance, we finally install Searx using the docker service using the following commands

1. Installing docker

`sudo apt install docker docker-compose`

2. Cloning the searx docker container

`git clone https://github.com/searx/searx-docker.git`

3. Use sed to replace the string in the .env file ‚ÄúReplaceWithARealKey!‚Äù with a random 33 digit string using the openssl command

`sed -i "s|ReplaceWithARealKey\!|$(openssl rand -base64 33)|g" .env`

We edited the .env file and inserted our custom domain after the SEARX_HOSTNAME= variable and added an email after the LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL= variable (required to get a valid SSL certificate)

We then ran the 1. startup script and 2. allowed the docker container to always start on system boot, and 3. started the docker container

1. `./start.sh`
2. `systemctl enable $(pwd)/searx-docker.service`
3. `systemctl start searx-docker.service`

After this setup the team1search.com website should direct you to our server and show the searx search engine.

# Notes:

# Specific Service Uses

- Caddy: Reverse proxy which is what is used to create the LetsEncrypt SSL certificate
- Filtron: Filtering reverse HTTP proxy and bot abuse protection
- Morty: Privacy aware web content sanitizer proxy

# Modifying Docker-compose Files

- Modified the caddy service entity  to use our specific domain name and SSL cert email ("SEARXHOSTNAME=" & "SEARX_TLS="
- Modified the filtron service entity to listen on all ports "0.0.0.0:4040" & "0.0.0.0:4041"
- Modified the searx service entity to use our domain name and morty url ("BASE_URL=" & "MORTY_URL=")
